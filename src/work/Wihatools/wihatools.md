## Overview

Wihatools.com is the ecommerce heart of Wiha Tools. Wiha Tools sells quality German hand tools, to the American markets (USA, Canada, and South America). With a strong base of 64,000 users each month, the website brings in about 10% of the company's million dollar plus annual income.

## My roles and responsibilities

I was brought onto the Wiha Tools team in 2019 with the main responsibility of upgrading and re-design their online store (based in Magento) from the current version of 1 to the newer 2. This upgrade was primarily needed due to security issues around the depreciation of version 1 as well the new opportunities that came with version 2 as well.

During my time at Wiha I was also responsible for many internal tooling as well, but the upgrading and maintaining of the store was my primary and daily focus.

## Problems and Opportunities

Working on digital storefronts brings with it a different set of problems from most other kinds of websites. On the plus side, selling physical goods are simpler and easier to develop for as the main goal is to sell goods and not maintain long lasting digital services and security to the customer. Although, on the other hand, even on the best storefronts online accessibility, performance and bloat are always present and remain a challenge.

Working for a small company provided many opportunities for me to design and develop outside of my comfort zone. I would many times come to my boss with ideas or suggestions and get the green light to incorporate them into the website in some way or form. This also meant that working with a two person team, many ideas or possibilities were simply too large and could not be developed with the resources on hand.

## Store Development

Working with open source software is always a bit tricky as it is not always thoroughly tested and not fully featured. There would be many times where I would be forced to develop a module for core functionality that was a few functions away from being perfect for our needs. Because of this I developed multiple modules (or plugins) for our store. These modules handled everything from displaying sku numbers on the category pages of a product, to running full inventory reports for our other storefronts and payment gateways such as Amazon and Klarna.

Other problems I would run into would be related to security and reliability of the online store. Wiha Tools is completely self-hosted and secured by Amazon Web Services (AWS), with this service, we were able to completely oversee and own our store from beginning to end. We also ran into many problems as well (especially in the early days of deployment) with the server needing to be restarted (many times in the middle of the night) and staying constant with security and technology updates. In the end it helped us remain on top of our competitors as we were able to remain much more agile and able to bring new requested features to the platform than that of our competitors.

## Feedback

The final thing that I did in the redesign and upgrade of Wiha Tools, was to listen. Customer feedback and voices are extremely important to the success of Wiha Tools and I was constantly listening to feedback, both from customer service and from my boss as Wiha has a very active and vocal fan base. I would keep every piece of customer feedback that was emailed to me and try to find ways to incorporate it into the website design, rather than to make a feature on the checkout easier to understand and use, or redesign a component on a product page for a more consistent browsing experience. Every voice was important to me and the company to help remain on the top of the hand tool market.

## Conclusion

There is a lot that goes into a full website redesign, and even more that goes into an upgrade and redesign of an online store. Through this whole experience I learn many valuable lessons and experiences that helped me to grow into a better and stronger developer. I also learned the importance of listening to the customer and people around you as it sometimes takes the people using the website and people working with the website to help create something that is truly unique and special for everyone.
