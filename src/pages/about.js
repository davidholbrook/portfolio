          <p>Iâ€™m an upbeat and enthusiastic website developer with twenty years of experience. I have experience with
            everything from server-side logic to client-side interactivity.</p>

          <h3>Entrepreneurial from the Start</h3>

          <p>From a young age, I have always been interested in how business works in the digital landscape. My
            background includes a degree in Entrepreneurial Studies from MCAD (Minneapolis College of Art and Design).
            All of this allows me to think uniquely through problems from more than just a technical standpoint but also
            from a human and business perspective, allowing me to understand issues better and find innovative ways to
            fix them.</p>

          <h3>Technical know-how</h3>

          <p>I started with PHP and MySQL and later added Javascript to my roster of programming languages. I have built
            multiple themes and plugins for content management systems such as WordPress, Magneto, Drupal, Expression
            Engine, Joomla, and many others. I am always learning new systems while keeping an eye on how to fix the
            problems in front of me.</p>
